The plot shows the relative error in the proportion of employee attritions, using simple random sampling, for sample sizes from `2` to `1470` (the size of the population).

Clicking "Regenerate plot" will select new samples for each sample size, and calculate the relative errors again.

Which statement about relative errors and sample sizes is true?
- For small sample sizes, each additional entry in a sample can result in substantial decreases to the relative error.
