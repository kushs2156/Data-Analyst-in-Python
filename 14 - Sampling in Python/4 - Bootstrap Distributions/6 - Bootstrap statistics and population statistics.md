Bootstrap distribution statistics can be used to estimate population parameters. But can you always rely on them to give an accurate estimate of an unknown population parameter?

Should the mean and the standard deviation of the bootstrap distribution both be used to estimate the corresponding values of the population?
- No, the mean of the bootstrap distribution will always be near the sample mean, which may not necessarily be very close to the population mean.
