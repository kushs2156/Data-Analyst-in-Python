| A bootstrap distribution consists of<br>many replicates of the statistic of<br>interest.         | The statistic of interest for each<br>bootstrap sample is always the<br>mean. |
| Each row in the dataset should<br>have an equally likely chance of<br>being drawn in a resample. | A bootstrap distribution is the<br>same thing as a sampling<br>distribution.  |
| Bootstrap resamples should be the<br>same size as the original sample.                           | Resampling means sampling<br>without replacement.                             |
