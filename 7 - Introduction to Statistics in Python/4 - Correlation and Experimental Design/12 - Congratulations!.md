Congratulations on completing the course! You now have foundational statistics skills that you can use in your analyses and build upon further.
## Overview
In the first chapter of the course, you learned about what statistics can do, as well as summary statistics to measure the center and spread of a distribution. In the second chapter, you learned how to measure chance and how to use and interpret probability distributions. You also learned about the binomial distribution. In chapter three, you learned about the normal distribution and the central limit theorem, one of the most important ideas in statistics. You also saw how the Poisson distribution can be used to model countable outcomes. In the final chapter, you saw how to quantify relationships between two variables using correlation. You also learned about controlled experiments and observational studies and the conclusions that can and cannot be drawn from them.
## Build on your skills
There's still much more that you can do with statistics and much more to learn. Your new skills will set you up for success in this course on the foundations of regression.
