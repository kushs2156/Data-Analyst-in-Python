Congratulations! You have completed all the videos and exercises. You should feel proud. It wasn't long ago when you started the course. Now you're like this high-performance race car when it comes to combining data. In this course, we covered a lot of topics.

In chapter one, you performed an inner join with the default settings using the merge() method. You also learned about the different types of table relationships and merging multiple tables. These are the basics of using the combining data with the merge() method. In the second chapter, you expanded your joining skills to many different types of joins. You also learned how to merge a table to itself and how to merge using indexes. In the third chapter, you learned about filtering joins, such as semi- and anti joins. You also learned how to combine data vertically with the concat() method and about the importance of data integrity. In the last chapter you discovered how to merge ordered and time-series data with merge_ordered() and merge_asof(). In the last lesson, you learned how to use melt().

Thank you for completing the course and for the time you put in. I wish you luck as you continue your learning journey.
