Chicago provides a list of taxicab owners and vehicles licensed to operate within the city, for public safety. Your goal is to merge two tables together. One table is called `taxi_owners`, with info about the taxi cab company owners, and one is called `taxi_veh`, with info about each taxi cab vehicle. Both the `taxi_owners` and `taxi_veh` tables have been loaded for you to explore.

Choose the column you would use to merge the two tables on using the `.merge()` method.
