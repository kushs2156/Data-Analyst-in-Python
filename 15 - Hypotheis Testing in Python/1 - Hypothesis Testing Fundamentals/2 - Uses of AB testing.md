In the video, you saw how Electronic Arts used A/B testing on their website when launching SimCity 5. One version of the page showed an advertisement for a discount, and one version did not. Half the users saw one version of the page, and the other half saw the second version of the page.

What is the main reason to use an A/B test?
- It provides a way to check outcomes of competing scenarios and decide which way to proceed.
