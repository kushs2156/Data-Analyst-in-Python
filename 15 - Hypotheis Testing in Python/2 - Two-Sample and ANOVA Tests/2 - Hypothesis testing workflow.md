- Place the hypothesis testing workflow steps in order from first to last.

| Steps | Processes                                                                      |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **1** | Identity population parameter that is hypothesised about                       |
| **2** | Specify the null and alternative hypotheses                                    |
| **3** | Determine (standardised) test statistic and corresponding null distribution    |
| **4** | Conduct hypothesis test in Python                                              |
| **5** | Measure evidence against the null hypothesis and compare to significance level |
| 6     | Interpret the results in the context of the original problem                   |
