Chi-square hypothesis tests rely on the chi-square distribution. Like the t-distribution, it has degrees of freedom and non-centrality parameters.

The plots show the PDF and CDF for a chi-square distribution (solid black line), and for comparison show a normal distribution with the same mean and variance (grey dotted line).

Which statement about the chi-square distribution is true?
- As you increase the degrees of freedom or the non-centrality, the chi-square distribution PDF and CDF curves get closer to those of a normal distribution.
